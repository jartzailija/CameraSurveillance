## Info
This part generates videos from images. Uses the ffmpeg -node module for it. Uses sqlite3 (also as a node module) database to save meta data.

If there are issue with "no file main.db or something", please generate it (touch main.db) manually to the databases -directory.

## TODO
* Prevent SQL injections
* Ensure main.db autogeneration
